# Bike Production Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization of a bike production dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights by handling inconsistencies, structuring the data efficiently, and creating visual representations.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.
- **Data Manipulation**: Applied filtering, sorting, and formula-based transformations for enhanced analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Created charts and pivot tables to display production trends and performance insights.

## Files Included
- `bike_production.xlsx`: The cleaned and processed dataset.
- `bike_production_analysis.xlsx`: The file containing visualizations and pivot tables.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Insights & Findings
- Identified production trends over time.
- Highlighted peak production periods and areas for improvement.
- Provided a clearer understanding of production efficiency and potential optimizations.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: To summarize and visualize key metrics.
- **Formulas & Conditional Formatting**: For data transformation and highlighting important values.

## How to Use
1. Open `bike_production_analysis.xlsx` to explore the processed data and visual insights.
2. Modify or update the raw dataset in `bike_production.xlsx` if needed.
3. Use pivot tables and charts to analyze new trends.

## Future Improvements
- Automate data updates using VBA or Power Query.
- Expand analysis with external datasets for deeper insights.
- Convert the Excel workflow to Power BI for advanced visualization.
